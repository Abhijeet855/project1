The error message you're encountering indicates a conflict between two different GPG keys being used for the Kubernetes repository. This can happen when you've configured apt to use one key for repository verification, but another key is being provided or detected.

Here's what the error message means in detail:

Signed-By: This is an option in the apt source configuration that specifies which GPG key should be used to verify the authenticity of the repository packages. It's used as a security measure to ensure that the packages you download are from a trusted source.

http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial: This part of the message specifies the repository (http://apt.kubernetes.io/) and the distribution (kubernetes-xenial) from which you're trying to install packages.

/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes.gpg != /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg: This part indicates that there's a conflict between two GPG keys that apt is trying to use for verifying the repository. It seems that one key is specified in your apt configuration file (kubernetes.gpg), but another key (kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg) is being detected or provided.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Check your apt sources configuration: Look into the files under /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ or /etc/apt/sources.list to see if there's any mention of the Kubernetes repository. Ensure that the correct key (kubernetes.gpg or kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg) is specified.

Update GPG keys: You might need to update or refresh the GPG keys for the Kubernetes repository. You can do this using the apt-key command or by reinstalling the appropriate keyring package.

Remove conflicting keys: If there's a conflicting key present in your system, you might need to remove it to avoid conflicts. Use caution when removing keys to ensure you're not compromising the security of your system.

Consult Kubernetes documentation: Check the official Kubernetes documentation or community forums for any specific instructions or known issues related to apt repository configuration.

Once you've resolved the conflict and ensured that the correct GPG key is being used for repository verification, the error should no longer occur when trying to install or update packages from the Kubernetes repository.
